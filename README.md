# klipper_scripts
Huge thanks to the author of (https://lazarofilm.gitbook.io/3d-printing/creating-a-github-backup-for-klipper) for getting me started with backing up Klipper to GitHub. I took it a few levels further and also backed up the Moonraker databases.
## backup_klipper.sh
This script will back up klipper, the moonraker databases, and update itself with the latest script from my repository!
