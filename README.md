# klipper_scripts
Huge thanks to the author of (https://lazarofilm.gitbook.io/3d-printing/creating-a-github-backup-for-klipper) for getting me started with backing up Klipper to GitHub. I took it a few levels further and also backed up the Moonraker databases.

This repository will store various scripts and macros that have been useful in the use of klipper. Many thanks to my 3d Printing pal, ANicoletti, who is cooking up the big logic on these macros and scripts - all I do is think up crazy ideas!
## backup_klipper.sh
This script will back up klipper, the moonraker databases, and update itself with the latest script from my repository!
